<h2>Five Short Sentences about me</h2>
<p>My name is Alexander Okenwa. I am a U.S citizen who was originally born and bred in Nigeria. 
    Then, in 2001, I came to the United States of America, and I have lived in the U.S for about 
    twenty-one years, today. I am sixty-two years, today, however, I have had all my primary, 
    secondary, and tertiary education in Nigeria. The first time that I have ever enrolled in a
     formal academic school in this country was in February of this year, which happens to be the
      time when I first enrolled in this El camino College, and I have been in it till date. 
      I love every academic experience that I have had and am still having in this college.</p>
